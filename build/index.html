      <h2>What is RootHacks?</h2>
      <p>RootHacks is this year’s iteration of the annual SystemsHacks event, a 12-hour beginner-oriented hackathon run
        by the SFU Software Systems Student Society. SystemsHacks has been organized annually since 2017, with over 200
        participants each year. Our goal is to facilitate an encouraging and comfortable environment for beginner
        hackers to learn new skills. The name “RootHacks” reflects a broadly plant-based theme, and we hope to inspire
        participants to consider how their personal roots can offer them a unique perspective when building their
        project.
        <!-- This is our first in-person hackathon since 2020, and we are collaborating with the Simon Fraser Student Society and Faculty of Applied Sciences to ensure a safe experience for all attendees. -->

      <h2>Software Systems Student Society</h2>
      <p>Software Systems is a program in Simon Fraser University’s School of Computing Science. Based in the Surrey
        Campus, it aims to teach more applied aspects of computer science so that graduates will develop a foundational
        understanding of industry skills. The Software Systems Student Society (SSSS) is the student unions representing
        the interests of the Software Systems student body. We organize events to encourage making valuable peer
        connections and supplement the academic experience.
        <!-- One such event is our annual SystemsHacks, which brings students closer to peers and industry professionals in a supportive environment! -->

      <p>The fastest-growing plant is the world is Burmese bamboo (Bambusa burmanica). It can grow up to 91 cm (35 in)
        per day. That’s almost 4 cm (1.5”) an hour. You could actually watch it grow.</p>

          A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-4 develop (or “hack”) a project in a short period of time. Hackathons are often 24 hours or a weekend, but SystemsHacks is 12 hours to make the experience less imposing for beginners. Hackathons are an opportunity to experiment with new tools, or try new ideas. They are also a great change to make lasting connections with fellow students, mentors, and industry professionals.

        <p class="content">
          You are not expected to have any experience to participate; everyone starts somewhere! The goal of the event is to learn something new; don’t worry if the final result is not particularly polished. Mentors will be available to help you work through questions that you may have, and we encourage you and your teammates to teach each other as well. Just remember, the primary goal of a hackathon is to learn!

        <p class="content">
          The theme can be interpreted loosely in whatever way you see fit; it is just a prompt to get you thinking. Your project does not necessarily have to be directly related to plants or roots, so get creative!

          If you already have a team in mind, each teammate must register individually for RootHacks. You do not have to notify the organizers of your team before the event, but projects must be submitted by a group of 2-4 people.

        <p class="content">
          You certainly aren’t the only one, many first-time hackers find themselves in the same situation! On the morning of the event, there will be a team formation event. We will ask all participants without a team to gather somewhere, where you can all form teams on the spot to ensure everyone can participate.

        <p class="content">
          Mentors can answer questions and help fix any technical issues that you may have, but they may not directly contribute to your project. They can also help you elaborate your idea in the early stages of the event, so don’t hesitate to ask if they have time to chat about your concept!
